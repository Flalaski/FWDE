## Codebase Comprehension

### Project Overview
FWDE (Floating Windows - Dynamic Equilibrium) is an advanced AutoHotkey v2 window management system that implements physics-based window arrangement and positioning. The project's core purpose is to create an intelligent, automated window organization system that maintains optimal spatial distribution of windows across one or multiple monitors using real-time physics calculations, while providing seamless user interaction and special handling for DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) plugin windows.

;; TODO (Medium): Add system requirements section specifying minimum Windows version, RAM, and CPU requirements for optimal physics calculations
;; TODO (Low): Include architectural diagrams showing component relationships and data flow visualization

The system operates as a background service that continuously monitors window states, applies physics-based forces for optimal positioning, and provides intelligent collision detection and resolution to maintain clean, organized desktop layouts without user intervention.

4. **Real-Time Configuration Monitoring**: Implemented configuration status checking and validation reporting with comprehensive error and warning systems.

### ✅ Configuration Persistence System Completed (2024-12-19)

1. **JSON Configuration Architecture**: Implemented robust JSON-based configuration system with schema validation, versioning, and migration support for future compatibility.

2. **Atomic File Operations**: Added atomic write operations with backup and recovery mechanisms to prevent configuration corruption during save operations.

3. **Hot-Reload Capability**: Implemented real-time configuration file monitoring with automatic hot-reload, allowing users to edit configuration files and see changes immediately without restart.

4. **Export/Import Functionality**: Created comprehensive configuration sharing system with export/import capabilities, enabling users to share configurations and create backups.

5. **User Interface Integration**: Added complete hotkey system for configuration management (Ctrl+Alt+S/R/E/I/M) with user-friendly interfaces for configuration status and management.

6. **Error Recovery and Validation**: Integrated configuration persistence with existing validation system, providing automatic error recovery and rollback mechanisms for failed configuration operations.

The configuration persistence system ensures users can maintain their preferred settings across sessions, share configurations with others, and enjoy real-time configuration updates without system interruptions.
