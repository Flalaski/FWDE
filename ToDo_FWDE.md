## Codebase Comprehension

### Project Overview
FWDE (Floating Windows - Dynamic Equilibrium) is an advanced AutoHotkey v2 window management system that implements physics-based window arrangement and positioning with sophisticated layout algorithms. The project's core purpose is to create an intelligent, automated window organization system that maintains optimal spatial distribution of windows across one or multiple monitors using real-time physics calculations, advanced bin packing algorithms, genetic algorithm evolution, and custom layout presets, while providing seamless user interaction and special handling for DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) plugin windows.

;; TODO (Medium): Add system requirements section specifying minimum Windows version, RAM, and CPU requirements for optimal physics calculations
;; TODO (Low): Include architectural diagrams showing component relationships and data flow visualization

The system operates as a background service that continuously monitors window states, applies physics-based forces for optimal positioning, utilizes advanced layout optimization algorithms, and provides intelligent collision detection and resolution to maintain clean, organized desktop layouts without user intervention.
