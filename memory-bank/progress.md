# Progress (Updated: 2025-08-02)

## Done

- Redesigned FWDE physics system from center-attraction to overlap-based repulsion
- Implemented user move detection to temporarily pause physics
- Added gentle edge repulsion to keep windows on screen
- Reduced physics timing for smoother, more subtle movement
- Added overlap calculation functions for accurate collision detection

## Doing

- Testing the new overlap-based physics system
- Monitoring performance improvements

## Next

- Fine-tune repulsion forces based on real-world testing
- Add visual indicators for manual lock states
- Optimize performance further if needed
